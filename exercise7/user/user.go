/*

For this exercise, you'll start with the code you just created for exercise
#5. You can paste it in below.

This exercise has one goal. Turn all the functions in the user package into OO
code.

You already have a constructor, so all that's left is to make the
PasswordIsValid() function a method that takes a User struct as the receiver.
